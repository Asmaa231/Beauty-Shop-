Beauty Shop


My project assists women and girls to find curated collection of high-quality beauty and skincare products, along with informative resources and personalized recommendations. Iâ€™m Asmaa Salem, web designer and developer, and this project is a frontend commercial application. 

I believe skin beauty is to what extent your skin is healthy and clear. 
Skincare is the magic solution for all the external skin problems, just cleanse with oily and watery products, so my motto is
"Good things come to those who double cleanse"

Based on personal passion, Chemistry and skin types study, people needs as well as, I created Beauty shop to offer a curated collection of high-quality beauty and skincare products, along with informative resources and personalized recommendations for women and girls.

Project results

Through the website, you can:
- navigate the products.
- check each product details by clicking its title
- add a product to the cart
- view all products in the cart
- remove it from the cart

Used technology:  HTML,  CSS,  JS.

The challenge I faced during developing this website was working by JS.
To debug its issues and make the web dynamic and interactive, I had to
concentrate much, test code and consult my peers. 

After finishing this project, I found that I get more patient and educated even if a small step. I gained new experience which resembles real-work examples, how to plan, design, develop, check quality, fix bugs, and manage time and projects.
